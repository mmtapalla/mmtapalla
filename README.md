# 💫 About Me:
I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Manila and with 5 months of IT work experience.

I grew up captivated by video games, which gradually sparked my interest in technology. At the same time, I nurtured my passion for art as a self-taught artist. Over time, I became curious if I could merge these two worlds to create something meaningful. And that’s where I am today.

When I'm not at the computer, you'll find me drawing, reading manga, hanging out with my dog, or playing video games.
